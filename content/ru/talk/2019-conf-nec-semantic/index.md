summary: Talk on conference
abstract: "According to the modest opinion of the authors, data science, machine
learning, neural networks are extremely relevant areas of
science. Around them there was an expectation that attracted lovers of
quick results. This does not detract from the importance and benefit
of these areas of science. In the paper, the authors took an attempt to
briefly describe their experience in organizing work with data
analysis using neural networks and machine learning methods."
