abstract: "This paper considers three types of tensor computations. On their basis, we attempt to formulate criteria that must be satisfied by a computer algebra system dealing with tensors. We briefly overview the cur rent state of tensor computations in different computer algebra systems. The tensor computations are illustrated with appropriate examples implemented in specific systems: Cadabra and Maxima."
