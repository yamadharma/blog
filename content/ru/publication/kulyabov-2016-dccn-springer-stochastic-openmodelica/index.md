abstract: "This paper studies program implementation problem of pseudo-random number generators in OpenModelica. We give an overview of generators of pseudo-random uniform distributed numbers. They are used as a basis for construction of generators of normal and Poisson distributions. The last step is the creation of Wiener and Poisson stochastic processes generators. We also describe the algorithm to call external C-functions from programs written in Modelica. This allows us to use random number generators implemented in the C language."
