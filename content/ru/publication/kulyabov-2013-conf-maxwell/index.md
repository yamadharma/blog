abstract: "In the problems of transformation optics have to solve extremely complex macroscopic Maxwell equations. To simplify the calculations, instead of macroscopic Maxwell equations in the plane space-time is proposed to write vacuum Maxwell equations in curved space-time. For this tensor polarization-magnetization geometrized in the sense of the field theory of gravity. As an implementation of this method calculates the lenses."
