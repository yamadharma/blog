abstract: "A series of theoretical and experimental works is known which investigated the magnetic properties of graphene structures. This is due, among other things, to the prospects of using graphene as a material for the needs of the future nanoelectronics and spintronics. In particular, it is known about the presence of ferromagnetic properties at temperatures up to 200 C and above in a single-layer graphene films that are free from impurities. Previously there was proposed a quantum field theoretical model describing the possible mechanism of ferromagnetism in graphene as a result of spontaneous breaking of spin symmetry of the surface density of valence electrons. The possible spatial configurations of the localized spin density were described. In this paper we investigate such spatially localized nonlinear spin configurations of the valence electron density on the graphene surface such as kinks, and their interactions, as well as quasibound metastable states of the interacting kinks and antikinks, that are breathers. The spectrum of such breathers is investigated. It is shown that under certain conditions, this spectrum has a discrete sector, which, in turn, allows us to speak about the possibility of coherent quantum generation of spin waves in graphene structures, which is important in terms of practical applications in nanoelectronics and spintronics."
