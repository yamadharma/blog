abstract: "The paper considers the technics of construction of optical devices based on the method of geometrization of Maxwell's equations. The method is based on representation of material equations in the form of an effective space-time geometry. Thus we get a problem similar to that of some bimetric theory of gravity. That allows to use a well-developed apparatus of differential geometry. On this basis, we can examine the propagation of the electromagnetic field on the given parameters of the medium. It is also possible to find the parameters of the medium by a given law of propagation of electromagnetic fields."
