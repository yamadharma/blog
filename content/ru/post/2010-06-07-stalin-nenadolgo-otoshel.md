title: Сталин ненадолго отошел
---



Сидят Рузвельт и Черчиль. Памятник называется «Сталин ненадолго отошел». ![http://pics.livejournal.com/yamadharma/pic/00013q3k](http://pics.livejournal.com/yamadharma/pic/00013q3k) This bronze, seated Churchill and Roosevelt statue called Allies was sculpted by Lawrence Holofcener and unveiled in 1995 by Princess Margaret. Located in downtown London in the pedestrian area in Old Bond Street, visitors to the statue frequently have their photograph taken seated between the two famous personages.
