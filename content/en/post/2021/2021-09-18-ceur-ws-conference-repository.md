### <span class="section-num">1.1</span> Fundamentals {#fundamentals}

-   CEUR-WS focuses on:
    -   workshops (rather not conferences);
    -   computer science (i.e. authors should mostly come from a computer science background).
-   CEUR-WS.org publishes computer science proceedings.


#### <span class="section-num">1.1.1</span> Computer science {#computer-science}

-   A computer science workshop proceedings is characterized as follows:
    -   The organizers and program committee members come overwhelmingly from computer-science departments and have a degree in computer science (or a related discipline such as information systems, business informatics).
    -   The vast majority of papers included in the proceedings have at least one author coming from a computer science department and/or having a computer-science degree (or a related discipline such as information systems, business informatics).
    -   The papers in the proceedings mainly apply research methods from computer science (or a related discipline such as information systems, business informatics).
    -   It is not sufficient to use computer programs for conducting the research while applying research methods from another discipline such as material science.


#### <span class="section-num">1.1.2</span> English {#english}

-   The majority (50% or more) of the papers in a volume must be in English.
    -   English is the de facto standard when you want to target an international audience.
    -   The submitted papers have to be written in the Latin alphabet. Spell author names in Latin characters (accents are allowed).
    -   Avoid non-Latin characters in the paper titles (in some cases special characters, e.g. for mathematical concepts, are allowed).
-   If you submit papers written in a language different to English, we must be able to verify the scientific character of the papers.
    -   Therefore, for papers written in a language different than English, we require that you provide an English translation of the paper titles in the index file and additional English abstracts in the papers.
    -   This is not just to be able to verify the scientific character of a paper, but also to make the content of these papers accessible to the international scientific community.
    -   An English abstract and title allows any scientist to decide whether the contribution of a paper is relevant to his or her research.
