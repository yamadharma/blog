    -   workshops (rather not conferences);
    -   computer science (i.e. authors should mostly come from a computer science background).
-   CEUR-WS.org publishes computer science proceedings.

-   A computer science workshop proceedings is characterized as follows:
    -   The organizers and program committee members come overwhelmingly from computer-science departments and have a degree in computer science (or a related discipline such as information systems, business informatics).
    -   The vast majority of papers included in the proceedings have at least one author coming from a computer science department and/or having a computer-science degree (or a related discipline such as information systems, business informatics).
    -   The papers in the proceedings mainly apply research methods from computer science (or a related discipline such as information systems, business informatics).
    -   It is not sufficient to use computer programs for conducting the research while applying research methods from another discipline such as material science.
