# Stalin departed for a short while

Roosevelt and Churchill are sitting.

The monument is called "Allies", but more appropriate, "Stalin departed for a short while."

This bronze, seated Churchill and Roosevelt statue called "Allies" was
sculpted by Lawrence Holofcener and unveiled in 1995 by Princess
Margaret. Located in downtown London in the pedestrian area in Old
Bond Street, visitors to the statue frequently have their photograph
taken seated between the two famous personages.
